"""Workspace application service for generating sponsorship intelligence.

This application service coordinates the existing sponsorship intelligence
orchestrator and persistence layer in response to a workspace generation
request. It loads the organization and initiative, verifies preconditions,
applies an explicit overwrite rule, runs the orchestrator, persists the
validated result, and returns a structured, UI-ready service result.

The service does not render templates, redirect the browser, flash messages,
read request data, call individual intelligence workers, or expose raw AI
provider output. It is independent of Flask route concerns and is fully
testable through injected dependencies.

            Injectable organization loader. Defaults to a database lookup.

            Injectable existence check used by the overwrite rule. Defaults to
