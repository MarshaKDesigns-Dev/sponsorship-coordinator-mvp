# Marsha AI Roadmap

## Purpose

This roadmap defines the planned development path for the Marsha AI platform and its first reference implementation, the Sponsorship Coordinator.

It separates completed work, active development, planned work, and future concepts so the project does not confuse implemented capabilities with ideas that have not yet been approved.

---

## Platform Direction

Marsha AI is being developed as a workflow-based artificial intelligence platform.

Its purpose is to support specialized AI employees that execute structured business processes through reusable platform services, domain-specific workflows, persistence, human review, and auditable records.

The Sponsorship Coordinator is the first reference implementation.

The immediate priority is not to build multiple AI employees at once. The immediate priority is to complete one usable, production-ready vertical product and establish the architectural patterns that future employees can reuse.

---

## Current Reference Implementation

### Marsha AI — Sponsorship Coordinator

The Sponsorship Coordinator supports organizations through the sponsorship lifecycle:

```text
Organization Setup
→ Initiative Definition
→ Asset Identification
→ Sponsor Strategy
→ Prospect Research
→ Outreach
→ Follow-Up
→ Opportunity Management
→ Relationship Development
```

---

## Remaining Work — Priority Order

Remaining work for the Sponsorship Coordinator, in priority order. Each item is expanded in the detailed sections below.

1. **Complete Workspace AI Integration**
   * Finish the application service tests.
   * Add the workspace generation route.
   * Connect the route to the new service.
   * Load persisted intelligence into the workspace.
   * Add generate and regenerate controls.
   * Display organization analysis, strategy, categories, assets, and research priorities.
   * Add route and template tests.
   * Retire the legacy static seeding behavior once the AI path is proven.

2. **Add intelligence review controls**
   * Generated, reviewed, and approved states.
   * Generation timestamps.
   * Controlled regeneration.
   * Version and history behavior.
   * Clear current-versus-prior intelligence handling.

3. **Complete production readiness**
   * PostgreSQL migration.
   * Authentication foundation (identity and sessions). This is the single authentication effort; customer signup in item 5 extends it rather than rebuilding it.
   * Customer and organization data isolation.
   * Secure secrets and environment configuration.
   * Structured logging and error monitoring.
   * Backup and recovery procedures.
   * Production deployment configuration.
   * Privacy and security review.

4. **Prepare the pilot**

   * Observe real usage.
   * Measure generation time and output usefulness.
   * Document confusion points and failures.
   * Fix only launch-critical issues.
   * Validate pricing and support needs.

5. **Add customer-facing product infrastructure**
   * Customer signup and login, extending the authentication foundation from item 3 rather than as a separate build.
   * Account setup.
   * Subscription or payment flow.
   * Customer onboarding.
   * Customer-facing help documentation.
   * Basic support and issue-reporting process.

6. **Improve background processing when justified**
   * Move long AI jobs out of the web request.
   * Add job status and progress tracking.
   * Add retries for failed AI calls.
   * Add scheduled follow-up jobs.
   * Add notifications when work completes.

7. **Improve the workspace experience**
   * Better loading states.
   * Partial page updates, likely with HTMX.
   * More usable intelligence presentation.
   * Clear next-action recommendations.
   * Better error recovery.

8. **Complete launch positioning**
   * Final product name and messaging.
   * Pricing.
   * Sales page.
   * Demo workflow.
   * Pilot testimonials and case studies.
   * Launch email and social content.

9. **Launch Sponsorship Coordinator v1**
   * Stable production deployment.
   * Pilot validation complete.
   * Payment enabled.
   * Customer data protected.
   * Core workflow documented.
   * Support process ready.

10. **Begin Marsha AI Employee #2**
    * Client Intake & Delivery Coordinator.

```

---

## Active Development

## Workspace AI Integration

The current feature is Workspace AI Integration.

### Objective

Bring AI-generated sponsorship intelligence directly into the application workspace so the user can generate, review, regenerate, save, and use strategic intelligence without leaving the workflow.

### Service-First Implementation

The first application service is:

```text
services/generate_sponsorship_intelligence.py
```

The service should:

* accept a workspace generation request
* load the organization profile
* load the active sponsorship initiative
* load relevant sponsorship assets
* retrieve existing intelligence records when required
* invoke the AI Orchestrator
* validate structured intelligence
* persist new intelligence
* return a UI-ready structured result
* remain independent of template rendering
* remain independent of Flask route concerns

### Planned Workspace Integration Package

* application service
* service result object
* error handling
* route integration
* workspace action
* loading and completion states
* intelligence display
* regeneration support
* persistence confirmation
* targeted service tests
* route tests
* template tests
* regression validation
* documentation updates

### Completion Criteria

Workspace AI Integration is complete when:

* intelligence can be generated from the workspace
* generated data is persisted
* existing records remain intact
* failures return controlled, actionable responses
* routes contain minimal business logic
* targeted tests pass
* the full regression suite passes
* documentation reflects the implemented behavior

---

## Next Production Milestones

### Workspace Intelligence Review

Planned capabilities:

* display current intelligence clearly
* distinguish generated, reviewed, and approved states
* allow users to inspect source context
* support controlled regeneration
* preserve prior versions where required
* record generation timestamps and status

### Sponsorship Initiative Workspace

Planned capabilities:

* initiative summary
* organization context
* sponsorship goals
* target audience
* event or campaign details
* asset summary
* strategic recommendations
* research priorities
* sponsor categories
* next recommended action

### Production Readiness

Planned work:

* PostgreSQL migration
* production configuration
* secure secret handling
* authentication review
* authorization review
* database migration strategy
* structured application logging
* error monitoring
* email safety controls
* production deployment
* backup and recovery procedure
* privacy review
* pilot data-isolation review

### Pilot Program

Planned pilot scope:

* recruit 3–5 nonprofit or sponsorship-driven organizations
* onboard each pilot organization
* observe real workflow usage
* document points of confusion
* measure time saved
* identify missing workflow steps
* review AI output quality
* validate pricing assumptions
* prioritize only launch-critical improvements

---

## Launch Milestone

The first production release should provide a complete and usable Sponsorship Coordinator workflow.

Launch readiness requires:

* stable onboarding
* stable workspace
* persistent sponsorship intelligence
* usable prospect research
* reviewed outreach
* follow-up management
* opportunity pipeline
* production database
* secure deployment
* customer data separation
* documented operating process
* pilot validation
* acceptable regression coverage

The launch target should not be delayed for speculative platform features that are not required by the Sponsorship Coordinator customer workflow.

---

## Platform Extraction Strategy

Shared Marsha AI platform capabilities should be extracted only when the Sponsorship Coordinator proves that they are reusable.

Likely shared capabilities include:

* AI Orchestrator
* model-provider configuration
* structured AI response validation
* generation audit records
* application-service result patterns
* workspace action patterns
* human review and approval states
* reusable document generation
* authentication
* authorization
* account and organization boundaries
* notifications
* shared deployment configuration

The project should avoid premature extraction.

A component should become a platform service when:

1. it is used by more than one domain workflow, or
2. its domain-independent responsibility is already clear, and
3. extracting it reduces duplication or risk without slowing delivery materially.

---

## Planned AI Employees

These are planned product directions, not active builds.

### Client Intake & Delivery Coordinator

Proposed workflow:

```text
Inquiry
→ Qualification
→ Discovery
→ Scope Definition
→ Missing-Information Collection
→ Proposal Preparation
→ Approval
→ Agreement and Payment Readiness
→ Onboarding
→ Kickoff Preparation
→ Delivery Milestones
→ Client Follow-Up
```

Strategic purpose:

Demonstrate that the Marsha AI architecture can support a revenue-producing service-delivery workflow beyond sponsorship management.

### Proposal Coordinator

Potential responsibilities:

* opportunity intake
* requirement analysis
* proposal structure
* missing-information detection
* draft generation
* review coordination
* version control
* submission readiness

### Grant Coordinator

Potential responsibilities:

* grant-opportunity tracking
* eligibility review
* requirement extraction
* document collection
* application planning
* draft coordination
* deadline management
* submission readiness
* reporting obligations

### Marketing Coordinator

Potential responsibilities:

* campaign planning
* audience definition
* content workflow
* campaign assets
* publishing schedule
* performance review
* follow-up actions

No additional AI employee should enter active development until the Sponsorship Coordinator reaches a defined production or pilot milestone.

---

## Deferred Work

The following items are intentionally deferred unless they become necessary for launch:

* broad multi-tenant platform redesign
* mobile application
* separate microservices
* event-driven infrastructure
* complex plugin architecture
* generalized workflow builder
* marketplace
* customer-created AI employees
* extensive theming
* advanced analytics
* native desktop application
* repository splitting
* speculative abstractions

Deferred does not mean rejected. It means the work is not currently justified by the shortest safe path to a usable and sellable product.

---

## Decision Rules

Development priorities should follow these rules:

1. Protect customer and development data.
2. Preserve passing behavior unless a deliberate migration is approved.
3. Complete active vertical features before opening new workstreams.
4. Prefer services over route-level business logic.
5. Prefer reusable patterns over duplication when reuse is demonstrated.
6. Do not generalize prematurely.
7. Build for the immediate customer workflow first.
8. Treat testing and documentation as part of feature completion.
9. Separate completed work from planned work.
10. Prioritize production readiness over feature volume.

---

## Current Next Action

The next implementation step is:

```text
Build services/generate_sponsorship_intelligence.py
```

This work begins after the Marsha AI platform identity documentation package is reviewed, tested, committed, pushed, merged, and the documentation branch is deleted.
